# SunspotAreaDifference
My attempt at plotting a sunspot number vs time graph for 1992 to 2020 (both daily and monthly), and only monthly for 1874 to 2016. 
For the monthly graph for 1874 to 2016, I compute the fractal dimension using Higuchi's method, and the Hurst exponent as well, to find the amount of persistency in the data.
